# LLM Steering Pipeline

This repository contains the two complementary steering pipelines described in
the paper: **SAE-based steering** (Sparse Autoencoder feature editing) and
**Probe-based steering** (linear-probe activation steering). Each lives in its
own subdirectory with its own dependencies and GPU requirements.

## SAE Pipeline (`SAE/`)

A reusable platform for building EDSL social simulations, collecting
model-agent game data, and inspecting those transcripts with Goodfire Open-SAE
features.

### Core workflow

1. Define a social-simulation game as an EDSL `GameSpec`.
2. Collect fresh model-agent responses with EDSL.
3. Run the open Hugging Face Goodfire SAE over the generated transcripts.
4. Compare behavior, top SAE features, cached Neuronpedia labels, and plots.

### What is included

- `social_sim_open_sae/` — package for declaring EDSL game specs.
- Example EDSL game modules for creativity, safe-risk/lottery, ultimatum, and trust.
- `scripts/run_edsl_social_simulation.py` — collect new normalized EDSL runs.
- `scripts/run_open_sae_feature_inspection.py --run-dir` — inspect new runs.
- Archived creativity task responses, GPT-5 Torrance judge scores, and Open-SAE features.
- Archived safe-risk, ultimatum, and trust outputs with full Open-SAE reruns.
- Paper five-condition safe-risk/lottery saved responses and source audit.
- Cached feature-description lookup and saved Goodfire steering provenance.
- Experimental live Open-SAE steering generation for new GPU-backed runs.
- Completed GPU evidence folders for release-critical smoke/full steering runs.
- Release completion audit separating completed artifacts from documented GPU extension paths.

### Key caveat — feature labels

The original hosted Goodfire Ember labels are not recoverable from the
open-source SAE weights alone. This repo uses Neuronpedia/Open-SAE replacement
labels from:

- Base model: `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`
- SAE: `Goodfire/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-SAE-l50`
- Hook: `model.layers.50`

Offline lookup: `SAE/data/processed/feature_description_lookup.csv`.

### SAE compute & cost

- Recommended GPU: 1× H100 80 GB.

## Probe Pipeline (`Probes/`)

The pipeline for the probe-based steering experiments (figures 7, 9–19).
Running it end-to-end produces the per-trial logs and the aggregated
`probe_results_final.json` that the probe figures are plotted from.

### What this implements

For each of two base models (`Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`, `Qwen-2-7B-Instruct`):

1. **Data generation** — sweep task parameters, record baseline choices, capture layer-`l` hidden states.
2. **Probe training** — `l2`-regularized logistic regression with cross-validated layer + regularization sweep.
3. **Lambda calibration** — coarse grid then bracketed binary search for target switching points.
4. **Steered experiments** — replay each task with the probe-steering hook at calibrated lambda.
5. **Creativity scoring** — GPT-5 judge via EDSL `QuestionLinearScale` (fluency, flexibility, originality, elaboration).
6. **Cross-object generalization** — train on subset of objects, evaluate on held-out object.
7. **Aggregation** — combine all per-trial JSONL logs into one JSON with 13 figure keys.

```

### Quick start (Probes)

```bash
cd Probes
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...    # for the GPT-5 judge
export HF_TOKEN=...          # for gated Llama weights

python -m probe_pipeline_final.run_all --model llama --outdir runs/llama_final
python -m probe_pipeline_final.run_all --model qwen  --outdir runs/qwen_final

# Aggregate into canonical JSON
python -m probe_pipeline_final.aggregator \
  --llama-run runs/llama_final \
  --qwen-run  runs/qwen_final \
  --out probe_results_final.json
```

### Multi-judge re-scoring

Five judge models across four providers:

| Judge | Provider | Model ID |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5` | OpenAI | `gpt-5` |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Anthropic | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `gemini-3.1-pro` | Google | `gemini-3.1-pro` |
| `kimi-k2.5` | Together | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct` |
| `deepseek-r1` | Together | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` |

```bash
python -m probe_pipeline_final.multi_judge_rescore \
    --in probe_results_final.json \
    --judges gpt-5 claude-sonnet-4-6 gemini-3.1-pro kimi-k2.5 deepseek-r1 \
    --out runs/multi_judge \
    --blind --length-controlled
```

### Probe compute & cost

- Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct: 2× H100 (80 GB) or 4× A100 (40 GB), bf16 — ~12–18 GPU-hours
- Qwen-2-7B-Instruct: 1× A100 or any 24 GB GPU — ~3–5 GPU-hours
- GPT-5 judge: ~10K–20K calls, ~$50–100

### Probe methodology

- Probe formulation: `score = wᵀh + b`, steering with unit-normalized `ŵ`
- Position scaling: intervention on last 20% of tokens, linearly scaled 0.5→1.0
- Layer selection: held-out CV sweep
- Median-split binary labels for probe training
- Coarse-grid + bracketed binary-search for lambda calibration

## Shared Dependencies

Both pipelines target **Python 3.10–3.13** and share the following key
dependencies (installed separately in each subdirectory):

- `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` (gated — requires `HF_TOKEN`)
- `Goodfire/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-SAE-l50` (SAE only)
- EDSL framework
- PyTorch / Transformers

## Public Release Safety

Neither subdirectory should contain `.env` files, API keys, model caches, or
browser data. The SAE subdirectory includes its own
`tests/verify_no_secrets.py` check.
